Marine Coders is excited to announce that it has officially partnered with Marine Innovation Unit (MIU) to form the MIU Marine Coders.

This team will coordinate bringing on reserve software developers as a force provider for software activities and programs in the Marine Corps. We believe that these developers will be a game changer to create a better, more lethal Marine Corps. These positions are rank and MOS agnostic, meaning anyone with the right technical experience can make a difference. The partnership with MIU will advance both MIU and Marine Coder's mission sets. We are proud to offer 2 reserve Selected Marine Corps Reserve (SMCR) positions.

This partnership will bring a few changes to the Marine Coders. First, this partnership cements the Marine Coders concept into the Marine Corps through official billets assigned to the Marine Coders. This is a huge step forward for Marine Coders from unofficial concept to official organization. As such, we've decided to rebrand our logo to showcase this. Second, this partnership allows us to move from an active duty centric model to a full range of employment through the reserves. We are excited with what we can accomplish in 2022 and beyond. Third, MIU Marine Coders will work under a force provider model. We believe this will allow us to accelerate existing efforts through the directed application of software developers who understand industry best practices.

A special thank you to Major Jim Carlson for making this a reality.
